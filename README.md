# Moving eyes project

This project is meant to be run within your browser. It has buttons to show a change in mood, JS and CSS manipulation. The main focus of the project is to have the eyes follow the mouse as you move it around the screen. On a mobile device the eyes move when the screen is tapped. 

# changes to come...

<ul>
<li> An update to the buttons to be more responsive on mobile along with reformatting the screen for mobile devices so it doesnt look so compact</li>
<li> Adding a mouth to help further show the different facial expressions</li>
<li> Adding an increased number of facial expressions</li>
</ul>

Enjoy this fun and playful project?
